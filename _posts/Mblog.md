## 4 reasons for...
for many years my mind was engaged with this questsion:"what is the perpose of my life?";now I think I have found 4 reasons for it:

- I think the most important one is "kindness";I mean that I should like other creaturs and never harm them.
- TO help others
- TO Have a part in making the world better place
- To enjoy from all the beautifull things that have been created.
